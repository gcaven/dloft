>I use Design Thinking and creative tools to humanize communication and technology. I am passionate about process, context and crafting meaningful experiences. I love working in collaborative environments—especially, if the people I'm working with are in love with what they do.

I’ve worn a few different hats throughout my career, but really at the heart of what I do is create useful and meaningful experiences. It can be manifested in an identity system that is easy to implement, or an augmented reality storytelling platform or a beautiful application. Anyone with a sense of style can make something look good, but I believe that design that has lasting value is achieved through a combination of aesthetics and inspiration, backed by scientific knowledge and research.

I embrace change, and have an endless curiosity to learn and experiment. I see difficult problems as an opportunity to learn and grow, if these sound like qualities you are looking for in a team member then I would love to talk to you.
