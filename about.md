>Hi. I’m Dee, and I use Design Thinking and creative tools to humanize communication and technology. I’m passionate about process and obsessed with context. I love working in collaborative environments—especially, if the people I'm working with are passionate about what they do.

I’ve worn a few hats throughout my career, but really at the heart of what I do is create useful and meaningful experiences—it can be manifested in an identity system that is easy to implement, an augmented reality storytelling platform, or a beautiful digital property.

I believe design that has lasting value is achieved through a combination of aesthetics and inspiration, backed by scientific knowledge and research. I embrace change, and have an endless curiosity to learn and experiment. I hope you enjoy my work :) If you do please get in touch.
