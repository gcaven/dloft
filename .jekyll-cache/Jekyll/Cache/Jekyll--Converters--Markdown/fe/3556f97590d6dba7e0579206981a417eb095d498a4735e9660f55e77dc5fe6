  <p>These System Performance Reports may look simple enough, but they took a lot of critical thinking and planning to get right.</p>

<h4 id="context">Context</h4>

<p>The Partnership works with groups and agencies across Canada to reduce the impact of cancer on all Canadians.</p>

<h4 id="challenge">Challenge</h4>

<p>Design templates for a series of reports relaying complex information and then to produce the first set of reports in French, English and accessible PDF versions.</p>

<h4 id="process">Process</h4>

<p>I needed to carefully craft a grid and typographic system that would align and differentiate three categories of reporting; Technical, Narrative and Special Study. The information in these reports were communicated through case studies, complex charts and figures, callouts, statistics and references.</p>

<p>Since the reports began as templates, the hierarchy of the typographic system was of prime importance. I designed a comprehensive style guide which helped me test the system and proved to be a useful tool when presenting concepts and design choices to the client, this document also allowed them to make informed decisions when requesting changes.</p>

<p>In the end, the client was so pleased with my work that I designed and produced the first three sets of reports. The system works extremely well and has been in use for the last 6 years.</p>
