<h4 id="context">Context</h4>

<h4 id="challenge">Challenge</h4>

<h4 id="process">Process</h4>

<p>When I was briefed on this project the development team had already produced wireframes and I was tasked with designing the layout and interface, however as I worked through crafting the grid and navigation system I found issues with accessibility and navigation. I worked with the development team to elevate accessibility standards and to simplify content and navigation.</p>

<p>I also designed a system for presenting quantitative and qualitative statistics on the site, as well as a series of infographics.</p>
