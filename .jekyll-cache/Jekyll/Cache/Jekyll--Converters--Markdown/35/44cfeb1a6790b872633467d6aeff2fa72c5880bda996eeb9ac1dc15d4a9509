<p>Patricia’s Bistro serves lovingly prepared sandwiches, pastas, soups and salads made from scratch. Named for the Chef’s mother, it provides patrons with a warm and inviting atmosphere and terrific food.</p>

<h4 id="challenge">Challenge</h4>

<p>Create and execute an identity for a new restaurant in a very short timeframe. Scope of work included design and implementation of the business proposal, interior design, logo, flyers, signage, menus, website and social media graphics and posts.</p>

<h4 id="process">Process</h4>

<p>With only weeks before opening the identity of Patricia’s Bistro needed a system that would be easy to implement and flexible enough to grow.</p>

<p>Vintage inspired typography; bright colour palette and simple shapes could be used in limitless combinations. In the beginning, typographic posters using food puns were to be displayed as large-scale posters to brighten the trendy black walls, but soon provided to be a source of inspiration and a voice for social media promotion, “Beet the Rush! Call your office lunch orders in”.</p>

<p>The result is colourful and quirky with a nod towards nostalgia—truly, a unique addition to the food landscape in Bedford.</p>
