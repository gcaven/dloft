  <p>Hi. Iâ€™m Dee, and I use Design Thinking and creative tools to humanize communication and technology. Iâ€™m passionate about process and obsessed with context. I love working in collaborative environmentsâ€”especially, if the people Iâ€™m working with are passionate about what they do.</p>

<p>Iâ€™ve worn a few hats throughout my career, but really at the heart of what I do is create useful and meaningful experiencesâ€”it can be manifested in an identity system that is easy to implement, an augmented reality storytelling platform, or a beautiful digital property.</p>

<p>I believe design that has lasting value is achieved through a combination of aesthetics and inspiration, backed by scientific knowledge and research. I embrace change, and have an endless curiosity to learn and experiment. I hope you enjoy my work :) If you do please get in touch.</p>
