<h4 id="context">Context</h4>

<p>Vintages of The Mind is a fundraising event for the Nova Scotia Early Psychosis Program (NSEPP). NSEPP promotes early detection and provides optimal healthcare for persons either experiencing (or at-risk for) their first episode of psychosis.</p>

<p>Design collateral for a wine tasting/silent auction fundraiser. And oh ya, you have three hours allotted for design.</p>

<h4 id="process">Process</h4>

<p>Normally three hours wouldn’t be enough time to design anything worth putting in your portfolio, but something about the name and subject of this event inspired me.</p>

<p>I started by quickly searching for facts about psychosis, the clients website (part of Dalhousie University) had a lot of relevant information. I kept those that I found impactful to the side and thought about how psychosis could be represented visually. I used optical illusions as a metaphor for mental illness, and gave the large posters context by adding the facts I had found.</p>
