> The power to power Toronto.

#### Context

In 2014 Toronto Hydro would complete the construction of a new transformer station 45 feet underground in Toronto's historic Roundhouse Park.

#### Challenge

Conceal the construction of the transformer station which is situated in one of the most visible tourist areas in Toronto. Roundhouse Park is directly across from the CN Tower, Rogers Centre and Ripley's newly constructed Aquarium.

#### Process

This project required a lot of planning and attention to detail. The first thing I tasked myself with was laying out the hoarding flat and dividing up the streets and corners. I built a flexible grid on top of it and used colour as a way to transition from one section to the next.

The location served as inspiration for the theme, “The Power to Power Toronto” fit perfectly with the hoardings surroundings. I used this theme as a way to tell the story of Toronto and Toronto Hydro’s commitment to contributing to city growth in a positive way.

 Another consideration in this design strategy is that hoarding needs to look busy enough to conceal graffiti, the collage style did not leave any white space to be taken advantage of.
