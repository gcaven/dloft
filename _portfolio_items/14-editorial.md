>I learned a lot about typography and grid systems from my time as an editorial designer. Itâ€™s a skill that I have found to be very useful in all areas of my work.

### Context

I worked as an editorial designer for two years on 11 publications that were published by-weekly. Since then I have designed countless annual reports and magazines.

### Challenge

The challenge with editorial design on a large scale is generating fresh layouts in a very small time span. You have to work quickly, efficiently, learn to experiment and be conscious of style guidelines. I used to think of them as puzzles, small pieces to arrange and then place in a larger context.
