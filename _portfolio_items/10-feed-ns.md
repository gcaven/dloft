>As part of Trampolines’ mission to be a force for positive change in Nova Scotia the studio collaborated in redesigning Feed Nova Scotia’s website pro-bono.

### Context

Feed Nova Scotia is a non-for-profit organization with a member network of 146 food banks and meal programs that distribute food across the province. Their mission is to feed those in need and reduce that need.

### Challenge

Design a responsive WordPress site and infographics for Feed Nova Scotia.

### Process

When I was briefed on this project the development team had already produced wireframes and I was tasked with designing the layout and interface, however as I worked through crafting the grid and navigation system I found issues with accessibility and navigation. I worked with the development team to elevate accessibility standards and to simplify content and navigation.

I also designed a system for presenting quantitative and qualitative statistics on the site, as well as a series of infographics.
