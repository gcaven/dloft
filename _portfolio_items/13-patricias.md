>Beet the rush!

#### Context

Patricia's Bistro serves lovingly prepared sandwiches, pastas, soups and salads made from scratch. Named for the Chef's mother, it provides patrons with a warm and inviting atmosphere and terrific food.

#### Challenge

Create and execute an identity for a new restaurant in a very short timeframe. Scope of work included design and implementation of the business proposal, interior design, logo, flyers, signage, menus, website and social media graphics and posts.

#### Process

With only weeks before opening the identity of Patricia's Bistro needed a system that would be easy to implement but flexible enough to grow.

Vintage inspired typography; colour palette and simple shapes can be used in limitless combinations. In the beginning, typographic posters using food puns were to be displayed as large-scale posters to brighten the trendy black walls, but soon provided to be a source of inspiration and a voice for social media and promotional messaging, "Beet the Rush! Call your office lunch orders in".

The result is colourful and quirky with a nod towards nostalgia, truly, a unique addition to the food landscape in Bedford.
