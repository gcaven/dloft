>The Proclamation of the Constitution Act of 1982 marked a pivotal moment for human rights in Canada, it was my honour to help bring this story to life.

#### Context

The Canadian Museum for Human Rights (CMHR) is the first museum solely dedicated to the evolution, celebration, and future of human rights. Their aim is to build not only a national hub for human rights learning and discovery, but a new era of global human rights leadership.

#### Challenge

Design an augmented reality app that tells the story of human rights legislation in Canada. The app will be used as an exhibit in the museum, and will later be available on the Apple App Store.

#### Process

This project has been a joy to work on. Though still in development, I am very proud of itâ€™s progress. When we began the client had only a script, and an idea that they could leverage technology to create a compelling exhibit.

My first task was figuring out how to tell the four stories the museum outlined. I examined many augmented reality applications and consulted the development team to ensure my concepts were realistic for both the timeframe and budget of the project.

I ideated four concepts and presented them to the client, the Avatar direction was chosen and the work began. I created detailed wireframes, and through an iterative process with the development team we refined the menus and interactive elements. I also conducted research for accessibility and made recommendations based on best practices and commonly understood gestures for the visually impaired.

When the wireframes were complete my next task was to produce detailed storyboards, including sound design. I illustrated and animated story features, and wrote an art direction brief for the 3D artist.

The app is almost complete, with only the professional voice overs and timing tweaks to be done. I am currently involved in design reviews and art revisions.
