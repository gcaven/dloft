> Strong presentation skills are of value in any work environment. I have written, storyboarded, designed and produced dozens of meaningful presentations for design studios and for their clients. Here are a few examples:

#### Brave New World / Show Reel

Brave New World is a boutique digital/technology agency that works on a wide variety of projects: websites, AR/VR, branding, large scale web applications, IoT, marketing, and even robotics. I designed and produced a short show reel that the studio could send to prospective clients and investors.

#### Buk Promotion Video

Buk is a social food discovery platform. It uses machine learning to find and recommend restaurants and dishes in any city around the world. Brave New World needed a short video to send to investors that explained the apps capabilities.
